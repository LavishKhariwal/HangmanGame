Hangman Game Rules:

1. The computer will choose a random word, and you have to guess it.
2. You can guess one letter at a time.
3. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word.
4. Each incorrect guess will add a part to the hangman drawing.
5. The game ends when you guess the word correctly or when the hangman drawing is completed.
6. The hangman drawing has 6 parts, so you have 6 attempts to guess the word.

Good luck and have fun playing Hangman!
