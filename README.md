# HangmanGame

🎮 Excited to share my first Python project - Hangman Game!🎉

🎯 About the Game:
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a secret word one letter at a time. With every incorrect guess, a part of the hangman's drawing is completed. The challenge is to guess the word before the drawing is complete!

💻 Tech Stack:

Language: Python
Libraries: Standard Python Libraries (no external dependencies)
🔍 How to Play:

Clone the GitHub repository.
Run the Python script and start guessing letters to uncover the secret word.
You have 6 attempts to guess the word correctly before the hangman is complete.
🤓 It was a fun and educational project that helped me strengthen my Python skills, and I'm proud of the outcome!
